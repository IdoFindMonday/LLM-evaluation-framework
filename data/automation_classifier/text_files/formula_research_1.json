However for the second number column I want the no of leave days to automatically deduct from the overall leave total. I have been manually inputting the data so they number if days is deducted in the Entitlement remaining column. Is there a formula or a way to automate this with the 2 number columns as it will just mean that you can see at a glance the number of days remaining without having to manually calculate. \n\nHope that makes sense but if not let me know.\n\nRegards,\nLaura Templeman\n\nlaura@key.digital \n01305 542000\nScreenshot 2023-03-17 at 12.56.56.png"

Sorry for the delayed response I was OOO.

I think that sounds somewhat correct, but what about the tasks not started and their duration? What we’ve been trying to achieve is the ability to provide an accurate % of all of our projects. Right now the way Monday works and the formula’s provided we have been unsuccessful.

Think of MS Project it tracks % complete by the tasks completed and the tasks in progress % complete/the total duration of all tasks to give a true % complete of all the project tasks to give the overall project % complete. Does that make sense?

Hi Prosper, 

Now that we're getting the hang of Monday.com, we're now using more formula columns. 😣

I'm looking to do 2 things:

1. SUM the ""Time Tracking"" column + ""Subitems Tracking column"" (at the parent level summarizing the subitems) and I want it to show up as hh mm, how would I go about doing that? 
2. Show how much time was actually used by taking the ""Est. Time"" Column (Numbers) and subtracting the ""Time Tracked"". Currently I'm using this formula:

CONCATENATE(INT( MINUS({Est. Time},DIVIDE({Time Tracking},3600))),""."",ROUND((MINUS( MINUS({Est. Time},DIVIDE({Time Tracking},3600)),INT( MINUS({Est. Time},DIVIDE({Time Tracking},3600)))))*60,0))

* However, the outputs are in decimal format. How would you recommend I get an output of h m s, just like in ""time tracking""?

Thank you!

Message: Good day.

I need help with developing formula for weight.

We are monitoring weight every month and currently, it alerts with 2 conditions
1. More than 5% of weight changes compared to the previous month.
2. Consecutive changes of more than 5% for three months.

with the following formula:
IF(AND({October Weight}*0.05 < ({October Weight}-{November Weight}), 
{November Weight}*0.05 < ABS({November Weight}-{December Weight}), 
{December Weight}*0.05 < ABS({December Weight}-{January Weight})), ""3X ALERT"", 
IF({January Weight}*0.05 < ABS({December Weight}-{January Weight}), ""ALERT"", """"))


However, the problem with this formula is that if we leave the box blank (let's say we didn't weigh the client on that month), then it will automatically regard the blank is ""0"" and alerts.

Could you please help me making a formula that has a condition that it does not alert if the weight is 0? (should be a precondition)

Thank you so much.

Kind regards,

Hi Prosper,

 

I have another formula question, is what I’ve written below possible?

 

The “Total less HST” formula column to auto populate with the “Rate Amount $” number column AND only calculate the “Rate Amount $” times “Hours” number columns if the “Hours” number column is populated?

 

 

A single client could have different types of services set to different rates and rate type. The client above has a mix of payment plants: the full cycle accounting is billed at $620 each month regardless of the number of hours spent, whereas the optional services are billed at $25/hour each month ONLY when requested by the client. 

 

Let me know if you need more information to assess if this request is possible.

Is there an app/formular that can output an incremental ID based on category L 1 &2 and previous count?

Another option we tried was “AutoID Column” app but this one requires some logic to be set up (works similar to the Automation) that might not work for us either.

The formula I’m trying to replicate is in column F (Total) which is: =IF(C3=""Y"",(D3*E3))

 

I have recreated the board in Monday here and attempted to create the formula, however, both ways I have tried either shows Total Award as ‘True’ or ‘100’ – I think the issue may be that the % achieved is not being viewed as a percent but there isn’t any percent column type to use.

 

 

Would it be possible to get some direction on this – I have watched a few Monday videos on YouTube but they are all straight numbers/text – I can’t find a percent example to follow.

 

Appreciate any guidance

Hi Prosper,

 

 

I hope you are well.

 

I have another query regarding our Monday.com board which we previously worked on with you at the end of last year.

 

Essentially, I would like to add on another board onto my workspace, as now we are in 2023, we need our previous board to be our 2022 one, and then a new 2023 board moving forward. If that makes sense?

 

But the ‘+Add’ button on our workspace doesn’t allow any of us to, as you can see in a screenshot, I have attached to you. Our current ‘City Fibre Diversions’ board will now turn into our 2022 one, and we want to almost duplicate our current main table, dashboard, and other 4 tables into a new 2023 one.

 

If you can please get back to me ASAP on how we can add another board below our current one, that would be much appreciated.

 

 

Many Thanks,

web,Not Specified,Re: Formula Assistance for WeWork,"This is a follow-up to your previous request #2396036 ""Formula Assistance for WeWork""

Hey Team - 

Hope you are doing well. I wanted to circle back with one additional enhancement request on this formula:

Currently, if WeWork is in the middle of a work week (Sunday - Saturday), the Weeks Out formula is showing the upcoming Sunday as ""This Week"" instead of ""Next Week"". 

For example, when we were looking at the board this past Friday (1/6)*, we noticed that the Comms Date of a given initiative was Sunday 1/8 but the Weeks Out formula was returning an output of ""This Week"" instead of ""1 Week Out"". Since Sunday represents the start of a new work week, the formula should have calculated the Weeks Out to be ""1 Week Out"" when we looked at the board on Friday (1/6). When we changed the Comms Date to Monday 1/9, it was correctly calculating an output of ""1 Week Out"". 

Is there a way to build a condition into the formula to ensure the Weeks Out formula returns an output of ""1 Week Out"" when the Comms Date lands on an upcoming Sunday (assuming we're already in the middle of their current Sunday-Saturday work week)? This is because Sundays always represent the start of a new work week. 

*I attached a video that we took on Friday (1/6) to walk you through an example

I am writing to you on behalf of the Fortil company.
We, in the different boards that we have, operate with figures of 4 decimal places and now, due to the new update, not only has the point been modified by the comma when putting decimal places, but you want to insert a number with 4 decimal places and you end up rounding it up.

Is there any way you can fix this issue?

We work with pieces that have a very low cost and the importance of monitoring all the decimals is very relevant when balancing payments and the different inputs of materials

Hi Noya, 


Thank you for sending me the updated formula. I just tried it out and every active deal we have in process is now considered Low Risk which doesn't look right. 




These deals should all be High Risk because their current status = Locked. 



These deals should also be considered High Risk because of any of the following reasons: New Construction, Last Activity Date is more than 4 days ago, or Appraisal Status = Cancelled, CC Form Signed. 





Can you please take another look?


Best, 
Paige

- Mirror column are like boiled vegetable. It only shows results in item and cannot be used for anything else (for sms, for formulas). If results from mirrored columns would work, my life would be so much easier. This is biggest failaure of monday.com, my opinion.
- Many things in mobile app are not working, like seeing mirror results. Rank 2/10. Trying to use monday.com in my phone browser (rank 5/10) but not good using like that.
- Monday seems to be hard to run, working slowly. Maybe because my board will contain 2000-3000 lines.
- LIVE feature sometimes not working. When I change in PC 1 , the PC 2 has to refresh to see updates.
- Twilio can not use price $ from mirror columns to use in their sms.

- I cannot find strikethrough feature, it would be great.

We have approx 300 items on the board. Most are slow moving. We would like to show movement because there are some items that do move, i.e. bateries and PIRs

Say we have 50 PIRs in stock. we then give 15 to a technician for Project X. We can put the 15 in a ""Stock Out"" column and formula in stock column ({Opening Quantity}+{Stock In}-{Stock Out} = 35)
1-15+0=35

However the next time we enter a Stock Out quantity it ignores the previous entry. Say we provide 7 for Project Y This would be 53-7+0=43

So there is no accumulitive action being taken

The same scenario applies to Stock In

Project X 15 (Stock Out) decreases total to 47",how_to

api,Not Specified,"Hi, we ran into a problem trying","Hi, we ran into a problem trying to create an important management tool based on the Gantt configuration and the Workload configuration.
The way we use Gantt was to create a project board, when we enter in each project the list of its stages as items, and estimate working hours for each stage. After that, the duration of each stage of the project is defined in timeline and from there in the formula we calculated the amount of workers required per day for that task.
The figure we are interested in extracting, which is the most important management tool, is to look ahead to the required manpower in the coming months.

We presented the figure of the required number of employees per day in the workload tool, when it shows the formula calculated as an average (there is an option to present it that way and not as a sum). Then we discovered that when grouping the data from a weekly view to a monthly view - instead of showing the required average for each day of the month - the averages add up to a total amount, and thus we lose the average and the critical management information we were looking for that allows us to look ahead.
Another thing we discovered is that in the Gantt configuration and the workload configuration it is not possible to arrange the data you see in a certain order. In Gantt - it is possible to change the position of the groups manually. And in the workload configuration it is simply not possible. One of the important tools was if it was possible to arrange according to the workload level of each project for a specified period of time. For example, to foresee the most demandable projects next month, that you can rank from the data. 

In conclusion -
1. Would it be possible to change the method of monthly grouping and set it to average of the data and not add them up as a sum?
2. Will it be possible to add an arrangement option in the Gantt view/Workload view by category (for example by the result in the formula).

api,Not Specified,"Hi,  I am trying to us","Hi,

I am trying to us the below IF statement to calculate the number of work days between today and a tasks deadline (using a timeline column) only if the task has started. The reason I want to do this is because I want to convert these days into work hours in a day and then calculate the remaining effort in hours between now and the due if the task has started. I am struggling to get the ""only if the task has started"" part right. 

Here is my formula for up until then: WORKDAYS({Timeline#End},TODAY())

The way I'm trying to measure if the task has started is by calculating the number of days between today and the task end date 
 - (WORKDAYS({Timeline#End},TODAY())) - and then saying if this is more than the amount of days between my start and end date, then populate the formula cell with 0. However, if it is not more than this amount, populate the amount of days between today and the timeline.

I hope this makes sense, below is my full formula. I might be going about this all wrong so I am very happy to receive any suggestions.

api,Not Specified,I am using the below IF statement,"I am using the below IF statement to calculate the number of work days between today and a tasks deadline (using a timeline column) only if the task has started. The reason I want to do this is because I want to convert these days into work hours in a day and then calculate the remaining effort in hours between now and the due if the task has started. It then converts the days into hours and sets the remaining effort column (formula column) at the effort (hrs) column value (number column) if the task has not started

IF(WORKDAYS({Timeline#End},TODAY()) > WORKDAYS({Timeline#End},{Timeline#Start}),{Effort (hrs)},IF(WORKDAYS({Timeline#End},TODAY()) > WORKDAYS({Timeline#End},{Timeline#Start}),""N/A"",MULTIPLY(WORKDAYS({Timeline#End},TODAY()),8)))

However, I have hit a problem whenever the number of work days in the timeline exceeds the amount of effort hours. This is relevant because some assignees will need 3 weeks to complete 2 weeks’ worth of work since they are allocated on other projects. What’s happening is the formula still thinks it needs to count these additional days as remaining effort.

Therefore, is there any way you can help me place a limit on the remaining effort value, the limit being the value in the effort (hrs) column whilst still ticking down as each day passes on the timeline?

Hi Tal,

 

Thanks so much for your support. I’ve gone ahead and followed your steps and created the HL budget board (which we’ve called Total Budget)- see attached.

 

What we’ve then done is then create monthly boards (Jan, Feb and March), which connect to the total budget board. This works for us but ideally what we want is just 1 yearly board that lists all the months (per group) and the total of each month connects into the total budget but we haven’t figured out how to do this.

Hi Amber,

I am back from my week-long trip. Thank you for your patience in waiting for my reply with more details.

As I mentioned, I am trying to add widgets on the Sales dashboard. One for the annual revenue target and the other for the annual sales quota. However, the existing widgets may not have all the fields and triggers to make it work.

For the revenue target widget, I have the target field and I can select the boards and specific columns but it doesn't give me the option to pick the Groups, specifically the Closed Won Group.

For the annual sales quota, the issue is very similar. There isn't an existing widget for it so I am trying to create one from scratch or use the annual revenue widget as template but this is what I need:

1. I need to set a target, so there needs to be a field for that (and it's there, so check)
2. calculate progress as SUM (check)
3. pick columns to track as goal: ACV (check)
4. pick boards: 2023 Deals (check)
5. then I need to be able to choose which Groups within the board(s): Close Won group. (not there, missing)

Both the annual revenue goal and annual sales quota goal widgets are from the same template and they don't have the select Group option.

Let me know if this explains what my request is. Thanks.

Dear Jerome,

I have created a little holiday calendar in Monday.com.

Now I wonder if there is a function in Monday that counts the days entered there, so that each employee can get an overview of how many days they have already planned or taken.

Maybe can I implement a column that gives me the numbers of days?

Please have a look to the board so far..

As you can see I implemented a date column for single days off and a date column for a range of days.

“Urlaub” = holidays

Thanks a lot for your help in advance

One candidate can be introduced to multiple companies and get multiple interviews/offers as well.

I already made a separate data board. Every time a status changes, an item will be created in this board. For example: When a candidate is introduced twice, a recruiter has to change status to introduced twice, then 2 rows will appear in the data.

From there i made a dashboard with charts, showing exactly how many times a recruiter introduced candidates etc. Like a Funnel chart. 

The chart sums up all the number I want. But I would actually like to use those numbers to create formulas, predications and such. 
Is it possible to extract those numbers from the dashboard, or from the data board i created?",feedback

1-	What is best to create to show number of days left or to go?
2-	Once having that number of days to go, I want a label column to automatically show a status (i.e. 30 days left, 20 days left, 10 days left, 5 days left, Expired)

Once the label is changed automatically, I know how to create an automated notification to let the item owner and others about the situation.

I am in the process of setting this all up for my team however had a couple of questions regarding how we can use this to suit us best. 

the first question is whether there is a way to collate the workload capacity across more than just one board? For example we have one board just now which is used for our main objectives and BAU activities that we can see the teams capacity view in workload for but if we were to have more boards ( different programmes, budget etc ) could we also have the subtasks within them incorporated into one overall workload capacity tracker ? 

My other question is whether we can amend the status of a main task so that it reflects the statuses of the sub tasks below ? For example if one 'main task' had two sub tasks one as completed and the other as Working on it could we have the main task status bar show as half and half ?

Because we are using this particular setup to keep track of an event agenda, I would like to be able to have subsequent times automatically update. So, for example if the “Hour 1” column in the first item shifts from 12:00 PM to 12:10PM, all the items below will push back 10 mins, keeping their “Hours_Diff” time intact, OR if “Hour 2” shifted, the subsequent item times would shift accordingly.

Is this something that’s possible to achieve?

The columns are Severity (Bugs) and Priority (Bugs).
The values of the Severity (Bugs) column are: Critical, Non Critical

The following combinations must give the P1 to P4 output:

Critical Severity - Urgent Prioriy -> P1
Critical Severity - Non Urgent Priority	-> P2
Urgent Priority - Non Critical Severity -> P3
Non Urgent Priority - Non Critical Severity ->P4

I managed to setup the following calcuation:
IF({Severity (Bugs)}=""Critical"",{Priority (Bugs)}=""Urgent"",""SP1"")

The problem is that it states true or false but it should give SP1.

api,Not Specified,"Hi there, I'm currently building a board","Hi there, I'm currently building a board that will use several different formula columns and I'm having some issues setting up the correct formulas.

One formula columns is to count the number of days since the start of a campaign, but for the count to stop when a end date has been selected. As we do not know when a campaign will end I have used the formula DAYS({Todays date},{Start date}) but I would like to amend the formula so the count stops after an end date has been entered.

We are using a formula to show todays date in a column, is it possible to make the shown info shorter so we can only see the date and month? (I've attached an image to explain further)

We also have some formula columns used to make financial calculations, is it possible to show a € beside the calculated value?

I need help to set up one formula in my board.

 

I have a dropdown column with 15 labels on it – I want to set up a formula column which will get a score from the dropdown column.

 

For example, if I have all 15 labels selected on the dropdown, I would like the formula column to be 100%. If there are 7 labels selected, 50%. If there are no labels selected I want to show 0%.

Is that possible?

 

I would like to stablish the percentage accordingly with the number of labels selected.

 

Could you please help me with that?

 

 

Please see above what I am trying to do, If fulfil is crispy caramel = 7%.

If fulfil is crispy caramel and milk choc & mint = 14%.

If fulfil is crispy caramel, milk choc & mint and peanut butter = 21%.

 

I know that the formula will be huge and I would like to know the right way to build it.

 

Many thanks,

Bea

The general formula of sum of {inventory - SOH} count works fine if we aren't in excess of something. eg, If sum of inventory is 890, and we could only 2, then we need to order 888 more. But if it is 890 and we have 1000, it gives us a negative figure of -111 rather than a positive, excess figure. I think in excel this is calculated via VAR (variance) formula?

Hello Prosper,

I hope you’re well. Thanks for sending the video.

Agreed, I would like to make the formula columns to NOT be dependent on each other. However, these 6 steps of formulas were the solve a previous consultant we had given to me because of an error that would come up in the formula. If we could find a solution that would allow one formula for “start week” and one for “end week” that would be an ideal solve.

The problem is that there seems to be an error in the system that when a timeline date starts on a Sunday it produces the wrong week # (i.e., week 1 instead of the correct week 2), that is why the extra 4 columns needed to be added. Is there a workaround to this issue? Also, please note that on our account it has always been to start on a “Sunday” as well (snip below).

Here’s a link (https://www.loom.com/share/23c77814886b41fb834cdae1b596d540) to my response video for more detailed information and examples.

@Andrew Montauk – Is there any way to get this resolved before the advanced training we have on formulas with the larger group on Friday?

I try to calculate how big the total remaining workload of a project is. 
I try to do that by adding a chart, add the workload in hours and filter the timeline as “future”.
For a small test project, this works out fine. But when I also link the board of a real project, things start to behave strangely:
•	The test project shows 24 hours for subitems and 27 hours for items (see print screen 1). Which is correct. But, when I also select the other board, the bars for the test project disappear and the 24 hours + 27 hours are added the subitems of the bigger project. Am I missing something?
•	Also… is there a way to sum the numbers for items and subitems?

Feel free to contact me to have a look at this together.

Dear Flo,

I just wanted to ask if it is possible to make an automation that registers the status as the group it was created in. For example if I create an item under the group cleaning the status registers to cleaning, if I created the item under Ad hoc the status column would be ad hoc.

I’m asking this since I use the status column as a label so whenever I remove an item from a group to my sprint planning – I can still see what group it came from.

For now I have to remind everyone that creates an item that they need to fill this out, which they don’t 😊

Hello Flo, following up as we are having difficulty adding one more aspect to this formula.

You provided this wonderful formula which will showcase “FY22” if any of the following is met:

IF(OR(AND({Production Start} >= ""2021-10-00"", {Production Start} <= ""2022-09-30""), AND({Production End} >= ""2021-10-00"", {Production End} <= ""2022-09-30""), AND({On List Date} >= ""2021-10-00"", {On List Date} <= ""2022-09-30""), AND({Launch Call} >= ""2021-10-00"", {Launch Call} <= ""2022-09-30"")), ""FY22"", "" "")

We would like the formula to showcase “FY22, FY23” if the dates also fall into FY23:

IF(OR(AND({Production Start} >= ""2022-10-00"", {Production Start} <= ""2023-09-30""), AND({Production End} >= ""2022-10-00"", {Production End} <= ""2023-09-30""), AND({On List Date} >= ""2022-10-00"", {On List Date} <= ""2023-09-30""), AND({Launch Call} >= ""2022-10-00"", {Launch Call} <= ""2023-09-30"")), ""FY22"", """")

How do we combine the formulas to state that if the production start date, end date, on list date, launch call date fall into FY22, it will showcase FY22….but also if those dates fall into FY23 we want the output to show both fiscal years i.e., “FY22, FY23”?

The amount displaying in the 'Donations Total column is still incorrect. See the below example:

The donor has been giving £10 per month for 6 years, 9 months. I calculate that to be 81 months in total, so at £10 per month the total donations should be £810. The total being displayed is £2,070, which is way off.

In formula column we are capturing only numbers.
So we have a use case like when we enter start date and number value present in formula column then end date column should be automatically filled.

api,Not Specified,We are working on building a board,"We are working on building a board (SMSF Leases Duplicate is our test board currently) in which every 1, 3 or 5 years the rent of the clients lease is going to increase.

Is there a way to automate the board to say when an expiry date passes, increase the rent by the value calculated in the formula column.

Hello! Thank you for this solution but I think it's a bit more complicated than what I would like to implement. So instead, I just want tickets that come in after 4:30 pm M-F to push the creation date to 9AM the next work day. Would that be easier to automate?

Hi Noya

Thank you very much for your suggested solution.

I have watched the video and as I understood, this solution will not work if we would select more than 2 articles per column. If this is the case, then the solution won't work for us, because most of the time we need to select more than two articles.

In that case we will probably have to use an external program for article management.

Can you please tell me, how can I duplicate the column ""Produktion/Dreh"" in the same board, so that also the duplicated column is updated as soon as it is changed. So said they should be twice in one board and show the same thing. I tried it with the mirror formula but somehow it didn't work.

I'm looking to create the following scenario and I can't wrap my head around how.

I run a real estate team, my agents get different commission splits based on their performance. The more they sell in 12 months, the larger split they get.

How can I create a formula or automation that assigns a % field on our deals board based on their current performance.

ie.

Agents that are under $150,000 in commissions receive 60% of the total commission
Agents that are over $150,000 in commissions  receiving 70% of the total commission

Agent A has generated $100,000 over 3 transactions. They are on a 60/40 split. 
We enter a deal for Agent A for $50,000 commission, we would like monday.com to total their commissions and assign the 60% split based on that total.

Total commission generated is now $150,000

Agent A sells another house, Because they're over $150,000 they are now on a 70/30 split.
We enter a deal for Agent A for $50,000 commission, we would like monday.com to total their commissions, realize they're over $150,000, and assign a 70% split based on their total.

** Else CSAT = OK (in amber)

email,Not Specified,Regarding Formula creation,"Hi Monday Team,
I am explaining my use case below, please find a helpful formula for below use case:

There is one dropdown column(Level) with 3 values L1, L2, and L3. On a level basis, we need to create a formula to maintain the hierarchy.

Explanation:
Suppose there is one group called ""Determine"" in that L3 is under L2 and L2 is under L1.
So here we need to maintain a hierarchy like this:

Levels            Sequence no.
L1                        1
L2                        1.1
L3                        1.1.1
L3                        1.1.2
L2                        1.2
L3                        1.2.1
L3                        1.2.2

So in the above logic, we need to create a sequence number on a level basis so that when the next L2 is coming then it will auto-increment the previous number. and when L3 is came it will align under L2.
This is one of the important requirement that came from our customer please look into it.

 We have 3 status columns named L1, L2, and L3.  
 In L1, values present like L1.1, L1.2, L1.3.
 In L2, values present like L2.1, L2.2, L2.3.
 In L3, values present like L3.1, L3.2, L3.3. 

 In above column L3 is under L2 and L2 is under L1.  So here we need to maintain a hierarchy like this:
Levels        Sequence no.
L1                   1  
   L2               1.1      
        L3          1.1.1       
        L3          1.1.2  
  L2                1.2      
        L3          1.2.1    
        L3          1.2.2



So we need to concatenate all these 3 columns in one formula to get an exact sequence number.
But when we normally concatenate these above 3 columns we will get an empty word so for that, I used the SUBSTITUTE function. And for taking the last digit value I used the RIGHT function.


But we want this sequence number in different formats like we want only the last digit of this value after concatenating like shown in the above picture (Sequence Number column).

So please help us on creating a formula.

Thanks and Regards.

As this is valid for Excel and is within the parameters of the types of formulas allowed by Monday, I haven't found any reason that this should not work and so I believe it is a bug. 

The result of using this formula as I have typed it into my board column (and as displayed in the attached screenshot) is that it returns a value when the Term Date column is filled in, but it does not return a value (it shows an error dot) when the Term Date column is not filled in. This is in direct conflict with the IF statement applied in the formula, and again, this formula when reproduced in Excel works exactly as intended.

They mentioned that in order for the Mirror column to properly display values, it needs to be visible on screen, this is to prevent unnecessary use of resources while interacting with boards (especially those with a large amount of linked items/subitems). In other words, you need to unhide the Mirror column that you'll be interacting with (in the screenshots you shared, the view you use has it hidden).
It's hidden because it's only showing values for every item after loading long time, it's no use for me. I need the mirrored column to show SUM from all the items, that's what I need.

They have also mentioned that a large number of linked items present in a board will highly impact the performance of the board since the Mirror column may take up to a few minutes to fully load all information needed and just then will start showing values, This is particularly noticeable in your board as it has a large number of subitems. Our developers are aware of this and are looking forward to working on improving the way the mobile app loads its information, but unfortunately, we do not have an ETA at the moment.
Yes we have alot of items and subitems, but what can we do? We have all our year schedule there, every appointment. If we use filter to show only 'last month', 'this month' and 'next month', will that have affect for faster loading speed? (it would be loading 3month instead of all year 12month)

Finally, the main issue causing the Formula not to show the mirror information was because of the formula column in the subitems, which contains both numbers and string literals (""true""/""false""), which the web currently converts ""true"" to 1 and ""false"" to 0 but in mobile, it was not supported. This is now changed and will be supported in the next update for the mobile app but it is best to change the formula to return 1 instead of ""true"" and 0 instead of ""false"".

Ideally we would like to make the total number of Hours x hourly rate (which is £12) and then add the extra FUEL expense £55, so we could see the totem sum of all of this.


If the above feature is only available as a paid option would it be possible at least to have a SUM field for the worked hours somehow?  sure I seen it being standard feature somewhere on your platform.

Instead of this formula: IF(FORMAT_DATE(SUBTRACT_DAYS({Deadline},

It is possible to change the “=” to “= or <”?

I want the formula to sign something when the alert time is starting and until the deadline. For example, if alert time is 30, 30 days before deadline the formula will sign “today” until the deadline – for 30 days.

Hi there Maya,

Sorry, I was out all week and couldn't check it.

Well, that's superb, so easy, thanks Maya!

Just to get all the knowledge about this function, how can I concatenate two datas? Street plus street number?
I've tried with "","" or "";"" but it didn't work.

Anyhow, this doesn't work for me and I also suggest to the development team to ""open"" more the info behind location, which is quite basic by now.
There's no formula to obtain the Province, Region, Post Code or similar (depending on which country we talk about).
Only Street, Street Number, City and Country.

Also, talking about the ""Location column"" it doesn't show either that info (the reason I assume there are no formulas to obtain that data)
This is quite important in countries like Japan or many other countries with crazy postcode organization or prefectures, inside a city, inside a province. But not only Japan, different countries have this too.

Hope this helps as a suggestion.

Thanks again for your help Maya.

Julián Ruiz

I was testing your suggested formula and I realized the formula is limited because it does not consider the status of a task.

I’m a new user to Monday.com and I’m in need of technical help. I hope you can help me.

 

I’m setting a table that provides an overview of project timeline and status.

1. I want to calculate the Target Completion Date for an activity based on the workload (“# of SSRs”) and “complexity” of the activity. I want the calculation to exclude weekends. Is this possible? Presently, because I’m unable to exclude weekends in my calculation, I have to spread 40 hours into 7 days multiply by individual capacity, which is assumed to be 30% (see factor 1.7 in my calculation for Target Completion Date below).

 

 

 

1. I’m having trouble getting the automation to work on Status. The system doesn’t seem to recognize the output for Target Completion Date as a date, so I reentered the output into another column labeled Target Due Date. The automation logic I selected for Status is shown below. As you can see, the Status remains “ON TRACK” when it should be “OVERDUE” based on the automation logic. Can you help me understand where did I go wrong with the automation?

 

 

 

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance for your help!

Hi Kristin,

 

Can you elaborate on what you're having trouble with the formula within a board? If it's a potential bug or technical source related, it's definitely a question best suited for support as they can look into the root cause and access your back end instance (whereas I cannot).

 

As for copy and pasting widgets from one dashboard to another, I can confirm that is not possible today. You can duplicate dashboards and tweak accordingly, but not sure that suits your use case. 

 

Let me know your thoughts!

There has been a change in the way the boards are getting managed. Need your help editing the formula. The status has now been reduced to a binary option. The custom status (Formula) needs to capture the status based on this binary input.

1. If the Status in empty and we are before the start of the timeline –Future step

2. If the Status is empty and we are within the Timeline – In progress

3. If the Status is empty and we are on the Timeline end date – Due today

4. If the Status is empty and we are beyond the timeline end date – Delayed

5. If the Status is Yes and we are on the Timeline end date – On time

6. If the Status is Yes and we are before the timeline end date – Delivered early

7. If the Status is Yes and we are beyond the timeline end date – Delivered late

I tried to edit your formula but the result was not as expected

email,Not Specified,API question - column_values query works for some boards but not others,"Hi Monday

 

I am querying all boards to see if there is a value in a particular column. All boards use the same ID for that column, which is timeline. My query requests that the column value is returned as text and then I simply carry out an action if ‘text’: in the returned JSON does not equal a blank string.

 

This works great for most boards. However, some boards refuse to return ‘text’. Instead, for ‘column_values’:, an empty array is returned, and so the program crashes when it can’t find index 0 of that array.

 

I’m not 100% convinced this is a bug in the API, but at the same time everything looks to be present and correct. I checked that the column ID has changed because another user has deleted and recreated a timeline column or something like that, but they haven’t. I tried querying other columns but got the same result: certain boards just refuse to return any value for columns. I tried returning the ‘value’: instead, but again, nothing.

Any suggestions? Could this be a bug?

Thanks

Is it too late to schedule a call to discuss what exactly I need help with and to answer a few questions I may have? Right now I am having a hard time making a board for my finances. Mainly because I cannot seem to find a way to connect columns. For example I am trying to set it up so when I make a change to a specific financial column, I can see how that that specific change affects other financial categories.

I am with Durable Surfaces (we have an account with you) and I need some help with widgets on our boards if you could please. We are a concrete construction company – we give out bids for projects that are either won or they are lost. So we want widgets to track our bids…

 

* First Widget Assistance: What widget can I choose to show me the total number of bids we put out? (Bids is one of our columns – it is set up as a stage column, and the stages are “bid, won, & lost”) – Can we also have a widget that shows how many of those bids were either won or lost?

* Second widget assistance: We are trying to track a specific timeline of the bids and I found the timeline widget, but I am unsure how to capture exactly what I am looking for, using that widget. Though, maybe this is the wrong widget to use? We want to know how long it takes from the deal creation date (which we have set as a column) to becoming a “won” / approved job (“Won” is one of our stages).

 

Is there any way you can help me using our board structure as we very much customized it?

 

Let me know, thanks so much!!

Obviously the first number column showing the number of days adds up the number of days as they are inputted. However for the second number column I want the no of leave days to automatically deduct from the overall leave total. I have been manually inputting the data so they number if days is deducted in the Entitlement remaining column. Is there a formula or a way to automate this with the 2 number columns as it will just mean that you can see at a glance the number of days remaining without having to manually calculate.

====================
I am trying to determine if I can use formulas (or other methods) to generate a calculated metric based on the values submitted by users from several drop downs.

Example:
-------------------------
Drop Down #1 has the following fields values
- High
- Medium
- Low

Drop Down #2 has the following fields values
- All
- Many
- Few

I would like to assign point values to each of the fields.....
- High = 3
- Medium = 2
- Low = 1
- All = 3
- Many =2
- Few =1

Based on those values, the formula would multiply the numerical value of drop down #1 times the the value of drop down 2.

Is there a method to assign point values to text values from drop downs and render a calculated metrics?

Example:
High = 3, All = 3 (therefor the calculated metric = 9

Can Monday support this and if so, can you please point me to support info so I can build that out? Thanks!!",how_to

email,Not Specified,Formula Column,"A few years ago, we created a board with a creation log column that shows the “Start Time” column below.

This start time column cannot be filtered as a date since it is a creation log column.

 

Via support chat it was recommended to me to use a formula column to extract the date from the creation log column so we can use the standard date filters. 

This was recommended so all records are updated, versus adding an automation to set a date on only newly created items.

 

Could you please describe how to use the formula column to extract the date from the creation log column titled “Start Time” and place this into a Date column called “Start Date” that we can use standard date filtering on.

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. Life got crazy. Now that it is settling down, I wanted to let you know that yes the formula worked.

My next set of questions for you regarding this is the following:

1. Our team has 2 types of meetings we chart data for. How can I set the formula to give me the (+/-) for each meeting type.

2. What is the best widget to show the change from the 4 questions we ask each meeting?

3. Can I set up a call with you to discuss this and how to enhance the board/features? This data goes to our CEO and top executives.

Hi Amber,

Yes the location is the difference

How would you like to calculate the avergae rating per site? Would it be the average rating across all different types of jobs as long as the location is the same?

As long as the location is the same we need to know the % of the completed standards of as standard 1 being the worst and 10 being perfect . EG 10 of the jobs were marked as 8 8/10 is 80% if on the other hand job no1. Was 6, job no1. Was 6, job no2. Was 10, job no3. Was 5, job no4. Was 8, job no5, Was 2 job no6. Was 5 job no7. Was 8 job no8. Was 1 job no9. Was 8. 9 jobs (9*9= 81) and standards are 6+10+5+8+2+5+8+1+8 = 58 so it would be 58/81 = 65% rating for that one location

If you think that I am misunderstanding what it is you are hoping to do or what the obstacle is that you are facing, please could you take the time to send a screenrecording walking me through exactly what you mean, and showing me how your board/s and workflow/s work. You can use the online tool loom.com (http://loom.com/) to record for free and send me a link to the recording.

I hope my description helps
